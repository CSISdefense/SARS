"108","T-AKE-SAR-25_SEP_2011.pdf","The LEWIS and CLARK Class Dry Cargo/Ammunition Ship (T-AKE) acquisition program will provide a two product (ammunition and combat stores - including dry stores, frozen and chilled products, spare parts and consumables) replacement for the aging single product combat stores (T-AFS) and ammunition (T-AE) shuttle ships. Working in concert with an oiler (T-AO), the team can perform a ""substitute"" station ship mission that will allow the retirement of the three product fast combat support ships (AOE 1 Class). In its shuttle role, T-AKE will provide logistics lift to station ships and other ships operating with naval sources from supply sources, such as friendly ports, and at sea from Modular Cargo Delivery System (MCDS) equipped merchant vessels.","T-AKE LEWIS and CLARK Class Dry Cargo/Ammunition Ship","Navy"
"109","Tactical_Tomahawk_December_2012_SAR.pdf","The Tomahawk Missile counters threats against United States Forces by destroying fixed and mobile targets, which include command, control and logistic systems, industrial and other high value targets, and fixed and mobile defense systems. The Tomahawk Weapons System (TWS) consists of the Block IV Tactical Tomahawk All-Up-Round (AUR) missile, the Tomahawk Command and Control System (TC2S), and the Tactical Tomahawk Weapons Control System (TTWCS). The AUR is an Acquisition Category (ACAT) IC program, TC2S is an ACAT II program, and TTWCS is an ACAT III program. Block IV Tactical Tomahawk provides major modernization to the existing Tomahawk technology by increasing responsiveness and flexibility at a more affordable production unit cost.","Tactical Tomahawk RGM-109E/UGM 109E Missile (Tactical Tomahawk)","Navy"
"110","TWS-SAR_31_DEC_2011.pdf","The AN/PAS-13(V) Thermal Weapon Sight (TWS) allows the Soldier to acquire and engage targets in all weather conditions. The TWS program supports the Army's objectives by increasing the individual Soldier's situational awareness, lethality, mobility and survivability during periods of significantly reduced visibility. TWS is used with a variety of individual and crew served weapons. The TWS supports the tactical level of war enabling the individual Soldier to see, understand, and act first. The TWS program provides the Soldier with advanced imaging technologies today. The TWS consists of an uncooled thermal imaging device. It significantly improves mounted and dismounted operational capability and supports weapon system performance, by increasing target acquisition range and enabling both day and night vision through smoke, fog, battlefield obscurants and in extremely low light levels. The TWS is produced in three configurations (light, medium, and heavy) to support the target acquisition range of the varied weapon systems. The TWS satisfies an immediate capability gap providing thermal imagery for the individual Soldier and is poised to capitalize on advances in technology, providing enhancements in all operating environments as well as size, weight and power improvements.","Thermal Weapon Sight, AN/PAS-13(V) (TWS)","Army"
